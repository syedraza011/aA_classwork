//A number's summation is the sum of all positive numbers less than or equal to the number. 
//For example: the summation of 3 is 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 
//the summation of 6 is 21 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. 
//Write a function summationSequence that takes in two numbers: start and length.
// The function should return an array containing length total elements. 
//The first number of the sequence should be the start number.
//At any point, to generate the next element of the sequence 
//we take the summation of the previous element. 
//You can assume that length is not zero.
